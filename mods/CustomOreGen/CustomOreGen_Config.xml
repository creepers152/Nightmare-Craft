*   CustomOreGen allows you to customize the generation of Ore within

*   place a specific block according to a specific
*   algorithm.  You can have as many distributions as you want, including
*   multiple distributions for the same block type.
*   
*   There are four basic algorithms available:
*   "StandardGen", "Susbstitute", "Veins", and "Cloud".

*   This file is written in XML.

                Enable/disable debugging mode, which allows the use of in-game wireframe models and console commands.  Also controls the visibility of some advanced options.

                This is a "magic" option - it has meaning outside of this file in the COG engine itelf.  You can change the value, obviously, but do not remove the option itself or change the possible values.

                This is a "magic" option - it has meaning outside of this file in the COG engine itelf.  You can change the value, but do not remove the option itself or change the allowed range.  Changing this value is really not recommended unless you know what you are doing.

                This is a "magic" option - it has meaning outside of this file in the COG engine itelf. You can change the value, but do not remove the option itself.  Recommended values are True/On for new worlds and False/Off for pre-1.4.2 worlds (for compatibility).

                This option completely prevents these ores from being spawned by the vanilla terrain generator. It is more efficient than a Substitute distribution, which lets the generator place an ore and then removes it.  However, for technical reasons this option cannot disable vanilla emerald generation. It also has mixed results with mod generation - mods that recycle the vanilla generator get disabled, while those that use their own do not.  Finally, it is an "all-or-nothing" approach that doesn't distinguish between ore types or world properties.  For these reasons this option defaults to "true", and a Substitute distribution is used below to selectively remove the vanilla ore deposits as needed.

                Enabling this is only one of the requirements to actually use wireframes - debugging mode must be on and the client must have Forge and COG installed, cheats enabled, and the wireframe rendering mode set up.
